This is basically a Typst project that takes a few [inputs](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/sys/) and generates a 630x1200 image suitable for serving as an `og:image`, for a given score, player name and date.

The code is overly complex cuz I had fun playing with Typst. It is probably full of remnants of old, now useless, code.

Currently, the image previews are built using the Typst command, but it may be better to run Typst as a library for performance/caching reasons.
